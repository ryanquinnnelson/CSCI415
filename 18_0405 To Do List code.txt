High Priority
8. Add graphing capability
5. Find good ratios of frequencies, charge, number of tasks to produce realistic behavior

Low Priority
3. Find a way to add new Tasks to the WaitAll() method
7. Add randomness to inhibitory, excitatory inputs

Nice-to-Have
4. Solve blocking issue with consumers
14. Setup number of dendrite, input axon, cell body tasks to dynamically depend on configuration settings for neuron
15. add a way to turn on and off whether the secondary messenger is involved (for experiments)
16. Improve method of causing dendrite growth event to happen occasionally but not all the time.
