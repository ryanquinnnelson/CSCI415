3. Find a way to add new Tasks to the WaitAll() method
4. Solve blocking issue with consumers
5. Find good ratios of frequencies, charge, number of tasks to produce realistic behavior
6. Make all configuration accessible directly from Main() method (i.e. no hard-coding deeper down in the code structure; everything comes to the top)
